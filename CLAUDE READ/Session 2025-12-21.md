# Strategy Session: December 21, 2025

## What Happened This Session

Morning brain strategy session with deep context review of both Cladari and Sovria projects.

---

## Documents Created/Updated

1. **CLAUDE READ/December 2025.md** — Full biography stream update (Layer 2 self-documentation)
2. **plantDB/docs/VOICE_MEMO_IMPORT.md** — Design spec for calm tech voice logging
3. **CLAUDE.md** — Added Voice Memo Import + Sovria Component Harvest to queued workstreams

---

## Key Insights Captured

### The Harvest Pattern
Sovria wasn't abandoned — it was harvested. Each "loop" produces infrastructure that feeds the next. Sovria → Cladari transferred: pgvector knowledge, embedding strategies, distributed architecture patterns, LoRA training experience.

### Stream Protocol Status
- **Layer 1** (Genomic): Future - MinION
- **Layer 2** (Biography): LIVE at www.cladari.ai
- **Layer 3** (Coherence): Queued - ML Vision Pipeline

### Family Tier Insight
The Christmas gift (plant from first cross + Cladari account) isn't a sidequest — it's a **product maturity dry-run**. Learning to ship means learning to hide complexity and identify what's essential.

## Active Threads to Continue

### PRIORITY 1: Family Tier (Christmas deadline - Dec 25)
**Goal:** Gift plants from first cross with Cladari accounts to Mom/Sister/SIL
**Approach:** Feature gating via `tier: 'family'` on Profile
**Effort:** ~4-5 hours

**What family tier SEES:**
- Plant card with photo
- Simple care logging (Water / Feed / Note)
- Photo upload
- Lineage tab ("This came from Dave's CLX-2025-001")
- Journal timeline

**What family tier DOESN'T see:**
- EC/pH fields
- Breeding pipeline
- Sensor integration
- ML predictions
- Batch operations
- Dashboard analytics

**Files to modify:** Need to identify components that need `{!isFamily && ...}` wrappers

### PRIORITY 2: Voice Care Data Collection
- Collect real voice memos TODAY (12/21) during care
- Also log normally (ground truth)
- Store audio in `plantDB/data/voice-care-samples/2025-12-21/`
- Post-holiday (12/30) will be rich data (8-day stress + care)

### PRIORITY 3: Dev Workflow Formalization
- Add feature branches to workflow
- Consider: `git checkout -b family-tier` for this work
- Future: Unit tests, automated security (P3)

---

## Priority Stack (Current)

1. **Family Tier** — Christmas deadline, product maturity exercise
2. **Voice data collection** — Today during care (no code, just recording)
3. **Breeding UI completion** — Harvest/seedling modals, graduation
4. **RLS policies** — Multi-tenant security for alpha
5. **Alpha user invites** — 5-10 serious breeders

---

## Queued Workstreams (CLAUDE.md)

- **HIGH:** ML Vision Pipeline
- **MEDIUM:** Voice Memo Import
- **MEDIUM:** Sovria Component Harvest

---

## To Continue This Session

New conversation should read:
1. `~/cladari/CLAUDE.md` — Full project context
2. `~/cladari/CLAUDE READ/December 2025.md` — Biography stream + strategic position
3. `~/cladari/CLAUDE READ/Session 2025-12-21.md` — This file (active threads)

Then say: "Continuing strategy session from 12/21. Priority is family tier for Christmas."

## Personal Context (For AI)

- Dave has ADHD, morning brain is strategic, afternoon fades
- This session = capturing morning ideas before they're lost
- Pattern: Systematic domain explorer, not "can't finish things"
- Collections are R&D, not hoarding
- Stream Protocol is THE synthesis (evidence: production deployment happened)
