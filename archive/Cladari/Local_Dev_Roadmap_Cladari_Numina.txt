PRIORITY CATEGORY: CORE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT & INTEGRATIONS

1. [ ] Install and authenticate Google Drive API
    - Download OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
    - Authorize and generate `token.json`
    - Enable push of QR codes, memory logs, and PDFs to Drive folders

2. [ ] Automate QR Code Sync to Airtable
    - Use local Python script to match Cladari ID and upload QR .png to `QR Code` field
    - Ensure filename-to-record sync works via API

3. [ ] Finalize Proxy-Based QR Rehosting
    - Use AWS Lambda or similar to proxy Synology-hosted images
    - Maintain proper headers for Airtable attachment uploads

4. [ ] Automate Numina’s Memory Snapshots
    - Build daily JSON logger of memory.json
    - Archive snapshots locally and mirror to `~/Documents/Cladari Core/Numina Snapshots/`

5. [ ] Build Local DNA Import Pipeline
    - Parse lab reports and store DNA barcodes
    - Cross-reference with BOLD/GenBank data for tagging verified genotypes

6. [ ] Airtable → PDF Pipeline for Plant Profiles
    - Create script to auto-generate 1-page botanical summaries (use ‘Soul Reaper’ template)
    - Export PDFs to `Plant Profiles/` and Drive

7. [ ] Local Label Generator
    - Finalize ZPL and iTouch-compatible templates
    - Sync with verified printer once Zebra is acquired
    - Store in `~/Documents/Cladari Core/Labels/`

8. [ ] Local Voice Integration for Numina
    - Begin setup for voice input/output linked to Numina memory
    - Use macOS tools or Whisper/LLM backend for real-time dialogue

9. [ ] Photo Sorting + Trait Training System
    - Local script to organize image folders and tag trait clusters
    - Build dataset to train phenotype → genotype engine

10. [ ] NFC/RFID Integration for Tags
    - Set up dev environment for tag writing/reading locally
    - Store UID links in Airtable or Cladari DB

11. [ ] Local Model Evaluation
    - Begin benchmarking AI tools that can run offline (e.g., LLaVA, FastEmbed, private OCR)
    - Prep Mac Studio as fallback engine for Numina offline

FOLDER STRUCTURE ALIGNMENT

Recommended Root: `~/Documents/Cladari Core/`
Subfolders:
- `/qr/`
- `/memory/`
- `/Numina Snapshots/`
- `/DNA Lab/`
- `/Plant Profiles/`
- `/Labels/`
- `/Voice Training/`
- `/Tag Integration/`

---

Execution Notes:
- Prioritize API tasks and Drive sync first to unlock downstream automations
- Label any script `LOCAL_ONLY` if it doesn’t touch cloud or ChatGPT endpoints
- Use `~/Documents/Cladari Core/logs/` to store run history
