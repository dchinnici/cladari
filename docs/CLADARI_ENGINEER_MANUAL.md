## 🌱 What Is This System?

The Cladari Plant Database is a comprehensive Anthurium breeding management system designed for serious collectors and breeders. It tracks:

- **Plant Collection**: 67+ plants, scalable to thousands
- **Breeding Records**: Parent/offspring relationships, cross tracking
- **Care Management**: Watering, fertilizing, health monitoring, EC/pH tracking
- **Morphological Traits**: Botanical-standard phenotype recording
- **Financial Tracking**: Acquisition costs, market values
- **Photos**: Growth progression documentation with cover photo selection
- **Vendor Management**: Source tracking and reputation
- **Environmental Monitoring**: EC/pH analysis, substrate health scoring

**Not just a spreadsheet:** This is a proper botanical database with:
- Relational data (plants link to vendors, locations, breeding records)
- Standardized taxonomy (dropdown fields prevent typos)
- Time-series tracking (measurements, care logs over time)
- Hot-reloading development environment
- API-first design (every feature has an endpoint)
- Photo management with EXIF extraction
- **AI Photo Analysis** - Claude Sonnet 4 vision for plant health assessment
- ML-ready infrastructure for future AI features

## 🏗️ Database Architecture (December 2025 - Supabase)

### What is Supabase?
**A full backend-as-a-service built on PostgreSQL:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Enterprise-grade relational database
- **Auth**: Built-in user authentication (email/password, OAuth)
- **Storage**: S3-compatible file storage for photos
- **Realtime**: WebSocket subscriptions (future use)
- **pgvector**: Native vector similarity search for AI memory

**Connection:** Via Prisma to Supabase PostgreSQL (pooled + direct URLs)

### What is Prisma?
**Your translator between JavaScript and SQL:**
- Defines your database structure in `schema.prisma`
- Generates TypeScript types automatically
- Prevents SQL injection and common errors
- Makes database changes through migrations
- Supports pgvector via `Unsupported("vector(768)")` type

**Think of it as:** A type-safe layer that prevents you from breaking your database

### What is pgvector?
**PostgreSQL extension for AI/ML vector operations:**
- Stores embeddings (768-dimensional float arrays)
- Cosine similarity search via `<=>` operator
- Enables semantic search across AI consultations
- Quality-weighted retrieval using HITL scores

### Database Tables (Current)

**Core Tables:**
```
Plant            - Main plant records with coverPhotoId
├── Genetics     - Genetic data (ploidy, RA numbers, provenance)
├── Trait        - Morphological traits (leaf, spathe, growth patterns)
├── Photo        - Plant photos with metadata (8 types)
├── Measurement  - Growth measurements over time
├── CareLog      - Care activities with EC/pH data
├── PlantJournal - Unified activity log for ML training
├── FloweringCycle - Reproductive phenology tracking
├── femaleParentId → Parent plant (female)
├── maleParentId → Parent plant (male)
├── cloneSource → Parent plant (asexual propagation)
└── seedlingOrigin → Seedling record (if graduated)

BREEDING PIPELINE (NEW v1.3.0):
BreedingRecord   - CLX-YYYY-### cross tracking (female × male)
├── Harvest      - Berry collection (harvestNumber, berryCount, seedCount)
│   └── SeedBatch - SDB-YYYY-### germination tracking
│       └── Seedling - SDL-YYYY-#### individual seedling records
│           └── graduatedToPlant → Plant (when promoted)

Vendor           - Source vendors and reputation
Location         - Growing locations with environmental data
Treatment        - Fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides
Species          - Reference data for accepted names
```

### How Data Connects

**Example: A plant's complete record**
```
Plant "ANT-2025-0042" (NSE Dressleri)
├── vendor → "NSE Tropicals" (Vendor table)
├── currentLocation → "Greenhouse A1" (Location table)
├── coverPhotoId → "clx123..." (Selected display photo)
├── genetics → {ploidy: "2n", raNumber: "RA8"} (Genetics table)
├── traits → [
│     {category: "leaf", traitName: "texture", value: "velvety"},
│     {category: "leaf", traitName: "color", value: "dark green"}
│   ] (Trait table)
├── measurements → [
│     {date: "2025-01-15", leafLength: 25.5, leafWidth: 18.2}
│   ] (Measurement table)
├── careLogs → [
│     {date: "2025-11-12", action: "water", details: {inputEC: 0.72, outputEC: 1.1}}
│   ] (CareLog table)
├── photos → [
│     {id: "clx123...", photoType: "whole_plant", isCover: true},
│     {id: "clx124...", photoType: "leaf", dateTaken: "2025-11-10"}
│   ] (Photo table)
└── journal → [
      {entry: "Watering with baseline feed", timestamp: "2025-11-12"}
    ] (PlantJournal table)
```

## 🔧 Common Operations

### Making Database Changes

**1. Edit the Schema**
```bash
# Open schema file
code prisma/schema.prisma

# Example: Add a new field to Plant model
model Plant {
  # ... existing fields ...
  floweringDate DateTime? # Add this
}
```

**2. Create Migration**
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_flowering_date
# This creates SQL, updates database, regenerates Prisma client
```

**3. Regenerate Prisma Client (if schema changes without migration)**
```bash
npx prisma generate
# Restart server after this
```

### Working with Photos

**Upload Photos via UI:**
1. Navigate to plant detail page
2. Click "Photos" tab
3. Click "Upload Photos" button
4. Select multiple photos (JPEG, PNG, DNG supported)
5. Choose photo type (whole plant, leaf, spathe, etc.)
6. Photos automatically extract EXIF data

**Set Cover Photo:**
1. In Photos tab, hover over any photo
2. Click the star icon to set as cover
3. Cover photo appears on plant cards

**Photo Storage:**
- Original: `/public/uploads/photos/`
- Thumbnails: `/public/uploads/thumbnails/`
- Naming: `{plantId}_{timestamp}.{ext}`

### EC/pH Monitoring

**Recording EC/pH:**
```javascript
// In care log, add EC/pH values
{
  activityType: "watering",
  inputEC: 1.1,    // Fertilizer solution EC
  inputPH: 5.9,    // Fertilizer solution pH
  outputEC: 1.5,   // Runoff EC
  outputPH: 6.2    // Runoff pH
}
```

**Understanding Alerts:**
- **EC Variance > 0.3**: Salt buildup, needs flush
- **pH < 5.0 or > 7.0**: Critical pH issue
- **pH Drift > 0.2/week**: Substrate degrading
- **Substrate Score < 50**: Consider repotting

### Backing Up Your Data

**Automated Backups (ACTIVE) ✅**
```bash
# Backups run automatically every night at 10 PM to Synology NAS
# - Full project sync to NAS (500+ files)
# - Database snapshots (last 30 days retained)
# - Time Machine hourly backups (local)
# - Photo uploads included in backup

# Manual backup anytime:
cd /Users/davidchinnici/cladari/plantDB
./scripts/backup-to-nas.sh

# Check backup status:
launchctl list | grep cladari
tail -20 logs/backup.log

# View database snapshots on NAS:
ssh dchinnici@100.82.66.63 "ls -lh Backups/cladari/db-snapshots/"
```

**Manual Local Backup (Quick)**
```bash
# Copy entire database locally
cp prisma/dev.db prisma/dev.db.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Backup photos
tar -czf photos-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz public/uploads/
```

**Export to SQL**
```bash
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db .dump > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

**Export to CSV**
```bash
sqlite3 -header -csv prisma/dev.db "SELECT * FROM Plant;" > plants.csv
```

**See full backup documentation:** `docs/BACKUP_SETUP.md`

### Inspecting Data

**Count records in each table:**
```bash
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db << 'EOF'
SELECT 'Plants:', COUNT(*) FROM Plant;
SELECT 'Photos:', COUNT(*) FROM Photo;
SELECT 'Care Logs:', COUNT(*) FROM CareLog;
SELECT 'Vendors:', COUNT(*) FROM Vendor;
SELECT 'Locations:', COUNT(*) FROM Location;
SELECT 'Journal Entries:', COUNT(*) FROM PlantJournal;
EOF
```

**Find plants by section:**
```bash
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db "SELECT plantId, hybridName, section FROM Plant WHERE section='Cardiolonchium';"
```

**Check EC/pH trends:**
```bash
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db "SELECT date, action, details FROM CareLog WHERE plantId='your-plant-id' AND details LIKE '%EC%' ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

## 🔄 Migration Strategy (When to Scale Up)

### Stay with SQLite When:
- ✅ Plant count < 1,000
- ✅ Single user (you)
- ✅ Photos stored on filesystem (not in DB)
- ✅ Query speed feels instant (<100ms)
- ✅ Database file < 500MB

### Migrate to PostgreSQL When:
- 📈 Plant count > 1,000
- 📈 Need full-text search across all fields
- 📈 Want semantic search (vectors)
- 📈 Adding DNA sequences (BLAST search)
- 📈 Processing 100K+ photos with embeddings
- 📈 Database file approaching 1GB
- 📈 Multiple concurrent users

### Migration Path (Future)
```bash
# 1. Export SQLite to SQL
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db .dump > migration.sql

# 2. Convert to PostgreSQL format
# (Prisma can handle this automatically)

# 3. Update schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"  # Changed from sqlite
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

# 4. Create new Prisma migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name migrate_to_postgresql

# 5. Import data and verify
```

**Estimated Timeline:** Not needed until 500+ plants or DNA/vector features

## 📱 QR Code System Architecture

PlantDB includes a QR code system for frictionless mobile data entry. Scan a tag → opens the right page with the right actions pre-selected.

### URL Schema

```
/q/p/{plantId}     → /plants/{dbId}?quickcare=true
/q/l/{locationSlug} → /batch-care?location={location}&quickcare=true
```

### QR Flow Diagram

```
Phone Camera → QR Code (Tailscale URL)
      ↓
/q/[...slug]/page.tsx (Redirect Handler)
      ↓
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┐
│ /q/p/{plantId}  │ /q/l/{location}                  │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┤
│ Lookup plant by │ Redirect to /batch-care          │
│ plantId (ANT-)  │ with ?location= param            │
│ or DB id        │                                  │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┤
│ Redirect to     │ useEffect detects param:         │
│ /plants/{id}    │ - Finds location by name         │

### Key Files

**QR Generation** (`src/lib/qr.ts`)
- `QR_BASE_URL`: Defaults to `http://100.88.172.122:3000` (Tailscale)
- Can override with `NEXT_PUBLIC_QR_BASE_URL` env var
- `getQRUrl(type, id)` - Build URL for QR content
- `generateQRDataUrl()` - Base64 data URL for display
- `generateQRSvg()` - SVG string for printing/scaling
- `generateQRMatrix()` - Raw boolean matrix for ZPL rendering

**ZPL Templates** (`src/lib/zpl.ts`)
- `generatePlantTagZPL()` - 2"x1" label with QR + text
- `generateLocationTagZPL()` - Location tags with plant count
- `generateQRGraphicField()` - Converts QR matrix to ZPL ^GFA
- Optimized for Zebra ZD421CN (300 DPI thermal transfer)

**Redirect Handler** (`src/app/q/[...slug]/page.tsx`)
- Parses `/q/p/{id}` and `/q/l/{location}` patterns
- Plant lookup via `/api/plants/lookup`
- Shows loading spinner during redirect

**Print APIs**
- `/api/print/plant-tag/[id]/route.ts`
- `/api/print/location-tag/[name]/route.ts`
- Query params: `?format=html|zpl|png`

### ZPL Label Layout (2" x 1" at 300 DPI)

```
+---------------------------+
| [QR]  ANT-2025-0036       |  (plantId - 40pt)
| [QR]  Hybrid Name Here    |  (line1 - 32pt)
| [QR]  Section             |  (line2 - 24pt)
|       cladari.app         |  (brand - 18pt)
+---------------------------+
600 dots wide × 300 dots tall
QR code: 150x150 dots (0.5" square)
```

### Tailscale Configuration

- Machine `f1` at `100.88.172.122` runs dev server
- QR codes encode this IP for phone → laptop access
- NAS `cheechnas` at `100.82.66.63` for backups
- Production: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_QR_BASE_URL=https://cladari.app`

### Testing QR System

```bash
# Plant tag preview (browser)
http://localhost:3000/api/print/plant-tag/ANT-2025-0036?format=html

# Location tag preview
http://localhost:3000/api/print/location-tag/BALCONY?format=html

# Test redirect (simulates QR scan)
http://localhost:3000/q/p/ANT-2025-0036

# Download ZPL for printer
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/print/plant-tag/ANT-2025-0036?format=zpl" > label.zpl
```

## 🕐 Timezone Handling

All date operations use centralized timezone utilities to prevent off-by-one bugs (care logged at 10pm EST showing as tomorrow).

### Key File: `/lib/timezone.ts`

```typescript
// Default timezone (configurable in future)
export const APP_TIMEZONE = 'America/New_York';

// Use instead of: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
export function getTodayString(timezone?: string): string

// Format existing date for form inputs
export function formatDateForInput(date: Date | string): string

// Parse form date at noon to avoid boundary issues
export function parseDateAtNoon(dateString: string): Date

// Relative time: "today", "yesterday", "3 days ago"
export function getRelativeTime(date: Date | string): string

// Check if date is today
export function isToday(date: Date | string): boolean
```

### Why Noon?

API routes create dates at noon (`T12:00:00`) rather than midnight to avoid timezone boundary issues:
```typescript
// In /api/plants/[id]/care-logs/route.ts
date: body.date ? new Date(body.date + 'T12:00:00') : new Date()
```

### Future: User-Configurable Timezone

The utility accepts an optional timezone parameter. Future settings page can allow:
- Auto-detect from browser: `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`
- Manual override in user preferences
- Store in user profile or localStorage

## 🤖 AI Photo Analysis Architecture

PlantDB includes Claude Opus 4 vision integration with extended thinking for intelligent plant health analysis. The AI can analyze photos alongside care data to provide diagnostic insights with explicit reasoning.

### Architecture Overview

```
Plant Detail Page → AIAssistant Component
         ↓ useChat hook (AI SDK)
    /api/chat (Next.js Route)
         ↓ loadImageAsBase64()
    Claude Opus 4 (claude-opus-4-20250514)
         ↓ Extended Thinking (16K budget)
         ↓ Streaming Response
    ReactMarkdown Rendering
```

### Key Components

**AIAssistant.tsx** (`src/components/AIAssistant.tsx`)
- Embedded chat interface on plant detail pages
- Two photo modes: Recent (3 photos) and Comprehensive (20 photos)
- Dynamic mode switching mid-conversation via checkbox
- Smart scroll behavior during streaming
- Markdown rendering with custom components
- Photo count indicator showing "X of Y photos"

**Chat API** (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Integrates with Anthropic Claude API (Opus 4)
- Extended thinking enabled (16K token budget)
- maxDuration: 120s for complex diagnostic turns
- Loads photos as base64 from filesystem
- Injects plant context (care logs, EC/pH, location, health)
- Streaming responses via AI SDK's `streamText()`

**System Prompt Enhancements (v1.5.1)**
- **Epistemic Rigor**: Distinguishes observations vs hypotheses, confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **EC/pH Delta Analysis**: Input composition context (Si raises pH), trend vs isolated reading analysis
- **No Confabulation**: Explicit instruction to verify data before assuming, ask before prescribing

### Photo Processing Flow

```javascript
// 1. Photos sorted by dateTaken (newest first)
const sortedPhotos = photos.sort((a, b) =>
  new Date(b.dateTaken).getTime() - new Date(a.dateTaken).getTime()
);

// 2. Slice based on mode
const photosToProcess = photoMode === 'comprehensive'
  ? sortedPhotos.slice(0, 20)  // Up to 20 photos
  : sortedPhotos.slice(0, 3);  // 3 most recent

// 3. Load as base64 and attach to message
const imageAttachments = await Promise.all(
  photosToProcess.map(loadImageAsBase64)
);
```

### Token Cost Management

**Understanding costs:**
- ~1.5K tokens per photo
- Comprehensive mode (20 photos) = ~30K tokens per message
- Recent mode (3 photos) = ~4.5K tokens per message

**Mitigation strategy (discovered by user testing):**
1. Start conversation with Comprehensive for initial deep analysis
2. Uncheck "Deep analysis" checkbox mid-conversation
3. Follow-ups use Recent mode (3 photos) at lower cost
4. Claude retains memory of photos from earlier turns

**Why images re-send on every message:**
- Claude API is STATELESS - no server-side conversation memory
- Images must be attached to every request
- This is unavoidable; mode switching is the only mitigation

### Configuration

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in environment:
```bash
# .env.local
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Usage in Plant Detail Page

The AIAssistant component receives `plantData` from the parent:
```typescript
<AIAssistant plantData={plant} />
```

Plant data includes:
- `photos[]` - All photos with URLs and dateTaken
- `careLogs[]` - Care history with EC/pH values
- `currentLocation` - Growing location details
- `healthStatus`, `section`, `hybridName`, etc.

### Example AI Analysis Output

The AI can:
- Trace morphological progression chronologically across photos
- Cross-reference visual symptoms with EC/pH data from care logs
- Distinguish similar issues (thrips damage vs Fe/Mn lockout)
- Question labeled hybrid identification based on morphology
- Provide substrate health recommendations based on trends

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

**Symptom:** `Error: Port 3000 already in use`
**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill existing server
pkill -f "next-server"

# Or find and kill by port
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Restart
./scripts/dev --bg
```

**Symptom:** `Error: DATABASE_URL not found`
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check .env file exists
cat .env
# Should show: DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"

# If missing, create it
echo 'DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"' > .env
```

### Database Issues

**Symptom:** "Column does not exist" errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# If that doesn't work, check schema matches database
npx prisma db pull  # This pulls actual DB structure into schema

# Or push schema to database
npx prisma db push

# Restart server
./scripts/stop && ./scripts/dev --bg
```

**Symptom:** Plants not showing up in UI
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check database has data
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Plant;"

# Check API works
curl http://localhost:3000/api/plants | jq length

# Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
```

### Photo Upload Issues

**Symptom:** Photos not uploading
**Check:**
- File size < 10MB
- Format: JPEG, PNG, or DNG
- Permissions on `/public/uploads/` directory

**Fix permissions:**
```bash
chmod 755 public/uploads/photos
chmod 755 public/uploads/thumbnails
```

### EC/pH Alert Issues

**Symptom:** False pH drift warnings
**Cause:** Including old data in averages
**Fix:** System now uses only last 3 logs for current values

**Symptom:** EC variance not showing
**Cause:** Unpaired readings (missing input or output)
**Fix:** System now only calculates variance from paired readings

### Plant Detail Page Errors

**Symptom:** Plant detail page shows "Unknown Species"
**Cause:** Missing hybridName and species fields
**Solution:** Edit the plant and add a name

**Symptom:** 500 error on plant detail page
**Check logs:**
```bash
tail -50 .next-dev.log
# Look for schema mismatch errors
```

**Common fix:**
```bash
# Regenerate Prisma client after schema changes
npx prisma generate
./scripts/stop && ./scripts/dev --bg
```

PATCH  /api/breeding/{id}/harvests/{hid}     - Update harvest
DELETE /api/breeding/{id}/harvests/{hid}     - Delete harvest
```

**Seed Batches**
```
GET    /api/seed-batches           - List all seed batches
POST   /api/seed-batches           - Create batch (auto-generates SDB-YYYY-###)
GET    /api/seed-batches/{id}      - Get batch with seedlings
PATCH  /api/seed-batches/{id}      - Update batch
DELETE /api/seed-batches/{id}      - Delete batch (only if no seedlings)
```

**Seedlings**
```
GET    /api/seedlings              - List seedlings with filters
POST   /api/seedlings              - Create seedling(s) (bulk supported)
GET    /api/seedlings/{id}         - Get seedling with full lineage
PATCH  /api/seedlings/{id}         - Update seedling
DELETE /api/seedlings/{id}         - Delete seedling (only if not graduated)
POST   /api/seedlings/{id}/graduate - Graduate to Plant table
```

### ID Generation

Located in `src/lib/breeding-ids.ts`:
```typescript
generateCrossId()     // Returns CLX-YYYY-### (e.g., CLX-2025-001)
generateSeedBatchId() // Returns SDB-YYYY-### (e.g., SDB-2025-001)
generateSeedlingId()  // Returns SDL-YYYY-#### (e.g., SDL-2025-0001)
generatePlantId()     // Returns ANT-YYYY-#### (e.g., ANT-2025-0070)
```

### Graduation Workflow

When a seedling is graduated:
1. Seedling must have selectionStatus = KEEPER or HOLDBACK
2. Creates Plant record with:
   - Auto-generated ANT-YYYY-#### plantId
   - femaleParentId and maleParentId from breeding record
   - breedingRecordId linking to the cross
   - generation (F1, F2, S1 auto-detected)
   - propagationType = 'seed'
3. Updates seedling:
   - Sets graduatedToPlantId
   - Sets graduationDate
   - Sets selectionStatus = GRADUATED
4. Updates breeding record f1PlantsRaised count
